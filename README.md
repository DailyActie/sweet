# Introduction
Official repository for Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology 
(SWEET) Ontologies. For more information, see [https://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov](https://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov) N.B. this Website will soon be transitioned over to https://esipfed.github.io/sweet.

# What is SWEET?
SWEET ontologies are written in the OWL ontology language and are publicly available. 
SWEET version is highly modular with 6000 concepts in 200 separate ontologies. 
You can view the entire concept space from an OWL tool such as [Protege](http://protege.stanford.edu/)
by reading in [sweetAll.owl](https://github.com/ESIPFed/sweet/blob/master/sweetAll.owl). Alternatively, these ontologies can be viewed individually. 

SWEET consists of nine top-level concepts/ontologies and is considered as a [middle-level ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28information_science%29); most users add a domain-specific ontology using the components defined here to satisfy end user needs.

# Community
SWEET is governed by the [ESIP Semantic Technologies Committee](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Semantic_Technologies) (STC) meaning that all proposed changes are evaluated by a number of subject matter experts.
